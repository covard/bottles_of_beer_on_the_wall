# Bottles Of Beer

This ruby script uses the OSX say system command to have your Mac 'sing' the 99 bottles of beer song.

It's fun and it will annoy people too :wink:

### Usage
After pulling the repo cd into the directory and use the following command and enjoy.

``` shell
$ ruby bottles_of_beer.rb
```

-- covard
